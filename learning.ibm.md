## Quantum Computing in Practice

Course Link: https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/quantum-computing-in-practice

The first course by Olivia Lane, Quantum Computing in Practice, helped provide some more background information to 
be able to apply the information I had previously to the IBM Quantum Platform. With topics such as the hardware of 
IBM quantum processors, the software Qiskit and its tools, designing quantum gates and mapping them to be most efficient. 
I'm particularly interested in how quantum computers can be used for mRNA secondary structure prediction as talked about 
in the lesson and in research here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20328. I hope to one day be a part of this research and 
follow along the same ideas to push human medicine to a level we have not seen yet.
