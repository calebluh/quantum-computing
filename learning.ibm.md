## Quantum Computing in Practice

The first course by Olivia Lane, Quantum Computing in Practice, helped provide some more background information to 
be able to apply the information I had previously learned to the IBM Quantum Platform. With topics such as the hardware of 
IBM quantum processors, the software Qiskit and its tools, designing quantum gates, and mapping them to be most efficient. 
I'm particularly interested in how quantum computers can be used for mRNA secondary structure prediction, as talked about 
in the lesson and research here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20328. I hope to one day be a part of this research and 
follow along the same ideas to push human medicine to a level we have not seen yet.

## Basics of Quantum Information

This second course, which John Watrous teaches, was an about 4-hour course
covering the following topics: basics of quantum information, fundamentals of
quantum algorithms, and some foundations of quantum data correction. Starting
with single circuit systems, then moving onto multiple circuit systems, before
introducing quantum entanglement examples such as quantum teleportation, 
superdense coding, and the CHSH game. This course also has a badge that I can now
 display on my LinkedIn, which is pretty cool. I think I'll have an 85% chance
of continuing my exploration in the quantum field. 

## Quantum Business Foundations

This course covers some high-level terms regarding what quantum computers can do, 
how they can improve businesses, and when the use of quantum computing can be
best suited. I feel ready to sell a business on the idea of investing in quantum
technology early.
